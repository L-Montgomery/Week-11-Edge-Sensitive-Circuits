## Lab Summary
In this lab we made a D-flipflop that then had the outputs of the JK-flipflop as its input for the data. Then we made a T-flipflop that then became the input for the J and K inputs for the JKflipflop.

## Lab Questions

### What is different between edge and level sensitive circuits?
The diffrence is the edge will only update when the input changes from zero to one. Level circuits look at the input at all times.
### Why is it important to declare initial state?
Its important because without it we wouln't be able to find Q because the inital state of the switch is unknown.
### What do edge sensitive circuits let us build?
Let us build time sensitve circuits like counters.
